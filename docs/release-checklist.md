# Release Checklist

Use this checklist whenever you prepare or publish a GitHub release for this plugin.

The owner decides when the repository or release becomes public. Do not create public posts, send listing emails, or publish external announcements as part of the build/package step.

## Before tagging

1. Confirm the repo is clean except for intentional release files.
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) with the user-visible changes.
3. Verify [README.md](../README.md) still matches the current install flow and screenshots.
4. Confirm the release version is consistent in:
   - `src/ClaudeUsagePlugin/ClaudeUsagePlugin.cpp` `TMI_VERSION`
   - [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
   - the git tag
   - release note title
   - zip asset names
5. Review [LICENSE](../LICENSE), [NOTICE.md](../NOTICE.md), and [PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md) for public-release readiness.
6. Build both targets:
   - `Release|x64`
   - `Release|Win32`
7. Confirm the build outputs include:
   - `ClaudeUsagePlugin.dll`
   - `ClaudeUsagePlugin\claude-web-helper.ps1`
   - `ClaudeUsagePlugin\helper\claude-web-helper\...`
8. Confirm the release zip includes `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, and `PRIVACY.md`
   at the zip root.

## Package assets

Create one zip per architecture from the built `plugins` output.

- Recommended asset names:
  - `TrafficMonitorAIUsageLimits_v<version>_x64.zip`
  - `TrafficMonitorAIUsageLimits_v<version>_x86.zip`

Each zip should contain this layout:

```text
LICENSE
NOTICE.md
PRIVACY.md
plugins
├─ ClaudeUsagePlugin.dll
└─ ClaudeUsagePlugin
   ├─ claude-web-helper.ps1
   └─ helper
      └─ claude-web-helper
         ├─ index.mjs
         ├─ package.json
         └─ package-lock.json
```

## Release page

1. Create a tag such as `v<version>`.
2. Use [docs/release-notes-template.md](release-notes-template.md) as the base release note, or use the prepared version-specific draft when one exists.
3. Attach newly built `x64` and `x86` zip assets from this exact source revision.
4. Keep the repository private unless the owner explicitly approves making it public.
5. Do not claim official Anthropic or OpenAI support.

Do not attach or rename older release ZIPs for a newer tag. The plugin DLL
version, tag, changelog entry, release title, and asset names must all use the
same version.

## Final smoke check

1. Test the `x64` asset with an official `x64` TrafficMonitor install.
2. Confirm TrafficMonitor loads `AI Usage Limits`.
3. Confirm `Claude 5h`, `Claude 7d`, `Codex 5h`, `Codex 7d`, `Codex credits`, `Claude resets`, `Codex resets`, and `Claude Fable 7d` appear in display settings.
4. Confirm the tooltip shows localized reset times.
5. Confirm Claude becomes unavailable if the helper snapshot is stale instead of showing stale values forever.
