# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- The Claude helper now loads the `System.Security` assembly before calling `ProtectedData::Unprotect`, so cookie decryption no longer fails on machines that only have Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- PowerShell invocation failures now report the underlying error from each candidate executable instead of a generic message.

## 0.3.13 - 2026-07-28

### Added
- Added a helper watch-lock regression test that uses a valid-looking unrelated Node process to reproduce PID reuse safely.

### Changed
- The PowerShell wrapper now launches the helper with an absolute `index.mjs` path and limits `stop` to the watcher validated by the current lock.

### Fixed
- Helper watch locks now validate the process name, command line, and process start time instead of treating any live reused PID as the watcher.
- Stale or unreadable watch locks are removed without terminating the unrelated process that currently owns the recorded PID.

## 0.3.12 - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Added DLL-level regression tests for current, legacy, reordered, and unknown Codex rate-limit windows on both x64 and x86 builds.

### Changed
- Codex session refresh now parses only the newest active file window instead of rereading every eligible historical JSONL file on each refresh.
- Compact taskbar items now use narrower bars and spacing, and hide the bar before overflowing a narrow host rectangle.

### Fixed
- Codex rate-limit metrics are now assigned by `window_minutes`, so a seven-day limit delivered in `primary` is shown under `X7d` instead of `X5h`.
- Payloads without `window_minutes` retain the legacy `primary` / `secondary` fallback mapping.
- Custom taskbar drawing is clipped to the rectangle supplied by TrafficMonitor, preventing overlap with neighboring taskbar content.

## 0.3.11 - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Added Korean and Simplified Chinese README translations.

### Changed
- Clarified why the plugin uses TrafficMonitor's taskbar surface for AI usage-limit visibility.
- Clarified that release zips should be extracted into the TrafficMonitor folder, not into `TrafficMonitor\plugins`.

### Fixed
- Stabilized Codex metric selection when multiple session JSONL files write conflicting rate-limit reset windows under the same profile.

## 0.3.10 - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Added an optional Claude web helper under `helper/claude-web-helper` plus the `scripts/claude-web-helper.ps1` wrapper.
- Added helper wrapper commands for `start`, `status`, and `stop` so the Claude watcher can run in the background and be inspected without manual process hunting.
- Added bundled helper asset copying to the plugin build output so the PowerShell wrapper and helper runtime can ship with the plugin release layout.
- Added project license, upstream notice, and privacy/local-data disclosure documents for public-release preparation.
- Added GitHub Sponsors metadata and README support link.

### Changed
- Claude now reads only a fresh `claude-web-usage.json` helper snapshot for live Claude data; if that snapshot is missing or stale, Claude shows unavailable.
- The Claude web helper now uses a dedicated local browser profile plus direct cookie-based `claude.ai` requests instead of replaying Playwright browser state.
- The helper wrapper now reports the watch lock, helper status, and current snapshot files so local troubleshooting is simpler.
- The plugin now tries to auto-start the bundled Claude helper watcher on plugin initialization, so TrafficMonitor restart no longer requires a manual `start` command when the helper files are deployed with the DLL.
- Bundled helper files now ship under `plugins\ClaudeUsagePlugin\...`, while `ClaudeUsagePlugin.dll` stays in the `plugins` root so TrafficMonitor can still discover the DLL.
- Public-facing naming now uses `TrafficMonitor AI Usage Limits` and `AI Usage Limits`, while the internal DLL and folder names remain `ClaudeUsagePlugin` for compatibility.
- README now documents the taskbar-first install flow, the one-time Claude login, and the meaning of the `C5h` / `C7d` / `X5h` / `X7d` labels more clearly.
- README was shortened into a quick-start focused landing page, with detailed install/runtime/build/troubleshooting content moved into `docs/`.
- Added a release checklist plus a short release-notes template so GitHub releases follow a consistent format.
- Release guidance now requires version consistency across the DLL, changelog, tag, release notes, and zip asset names.
- Refreshed the compact taskbar screenshot to show the Claude/Codex-only layout more clearly.
- Removed the deprecated Claude statusline wrapper scripts, so the repo no longer ships the unused `ccstatusline` integration path.
- Claude and Codex taskbar items now consistently show used percentages instead of mixing used and remaining semantics.
- Codex now uses local session JSONL files as its only usage source; the stale `logs_2.sqlite` fallback was removed.
- README screenshots were refreshed with the current compact taskbar and tooltip layout.
- Release zip assets now include `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, and `PRIVACY.md` at the root.

### Fixed
- Claude no longer keeps stale local fallback values indefinitely when the live source is unavailable.
- The Claude web helper now keeps the most recent successful helper snapshot across transient `request_failed` fetch errors, while the DLL still expires that snapshot after the existing 90-second freshness window.
- The Claude web helper now uses the current `lastActiveOrg` cookie to call `GET /api/organizations/{orgId}/usage` directly before falling back to the broader organizations lookup, avoiding the `GET /api/organizations` 500 path that could leave Claude unavailable even with a valid signed-in web session.
- Claude runtime now uses the helper snapshot as its only live Claude source, with a simpler `helper -> short fresh snapshot -> unavailable` model instead of OAuth/statusline/plugin-cache fallbacks.
- Removed the remaining legacy OAuth/statusline/plugin-cache Claude runtime code paths from the DLL after the helper-only runtime simplification.
- Codex session selection now uses the newest rate-limit event timestamp instead of JSONL file modification time.
- Codex session parsing now ignores embedded `rate_limits` text from tool output logs.
- Codex can now read active session JSONL files while Codex is still writing them, avoiding stale fallback values.

## 0.3.7 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Claude tooltip errors now include the concrete HTTP status for denied and rate-limited API responses.

### Fixed
- Claude cached fallback responses no longer mark API failures as a successful refresh, so auth and rate-limit states recover on the shorter retry cadence.

## 0.3.6 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Claude now tries the OAuth usage endpoint first and only falls back to the freshest available local snapshot when the live request is unavailable.

### Fixed
- Fresh Claude statusline cache no longer masks newer live API data when Claude Code is not actively updating the local bridge cache.

## 0.3.5 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Shifted the `7d` bars further toward muted gray-blue and gray-green tones so they remain visibly secondary to `5h` in the compact taskbar UI.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Muted the `7d` bar colors for Claude and Codex so `5h` reads as the primary usage signal in the compact taskbar layout.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Increased the visual separation between `5h` and `7d` bar colors while keeping a single color family per provider.

### Fixed
- Usage bar layout now reserves a realistic fixed value-text width (`99.9%`), so bars stay stable without becoming unnecessarily short.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Usage bar width now reserves a fixed value-text area, so bar length no longer changes with `9%` vs `10%` style digit-count differences.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Claude usage now uses only the plugin's own cached API snapshot as the Claude fallback source.
- Claude now prefers an official Claude Code statusline bridge cache when configured, with the OAuth usage endpoint retained as fallback.
- Claude local cache and statusline bridge files now live under `trafficmonitor-claude-usage-plugin`, with backward-compatible reads from the previous `trafficmonitor-ai-usage-plugin` path.
- Added a WSL Claude Code statusline wrapper path so WSL sessions can write the Windows-readable Claude bridge cache directly.
- Tooltips no longer expose internal `Source:` labels.
- Claude and Codex usage bars now keep one color family per provider, with a slightly stronger tone for `5h` than `7d`.

### Fixed
- Claude usage polling now respects `Retry-After` when the Anthropic usage API returns `429 rate limited`, instead of retrying every 5 seconds.
- Claude refresh scheduling now measures the next poll window from the completed request time, which avoids retrying earlier than intended after slow API calls.
- Claude and Codex reset timestamps in tooltips now follow the Windows user locale date/time format instead of a fixed `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` string.
- Fresh Claude statusline bridge cache can now be picked up immediately even while the OAuth API is still in `Retry-After` backoff.
- Fresh Claude statusline bridge cache is now re-read every 5 seconds instead of waiting for the 180 second OAuth success interval.
- Codex tooltip reset timestamps now parse the current local `reset_at` field emitted by Codex websocket rate-limit events.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Added `Codex 5h` and `Codex 7d` items to the same plugin DLL.
- Added tooltip reset timing for Claude and Codex when reset metadata is available.

### Changed
- README now documents the combined Claude/Codex behavior and local Codex data sources.

### Fixed
- Codex snapshot reads now use the same guarded snapshot pattern as Claude.
- Failed refreshes retry after 5 seconds instead of waiting a full minute.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Extracted `ClaudeUsagePlugin` into a standalone private repository.
- Documented the standalone build layout and install flow for `ClaudeUsagePlugin.dll`.

### Changed
- Reworked the README for the standalone repo and DLL-only delivery model.

### Fixed
- Refresh failures now fall back to `unavailable` instead of keeping stale values.
